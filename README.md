## Project Structure

The project is contained in a single file `DS.cpp`, which includes all the necessary functions and data structures.

[A class diagram or system architecture diagram could be added here to visualize the structure of the program]

## Data Structures Used

- `struct Food`: Represents a food item with name, ID, price, and quantity.
- `struct Bill`: Represents a bill or invoice with customer details, items, and delivery information.
- `vector<Food>`: Used to store the food menu.
- `vector<string>`: Used to store user names.

## Future Improvements

- Implement data persistence (file I/O or database integration)
- Add more robust error handling and logging
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Add unit tests for critical functions
